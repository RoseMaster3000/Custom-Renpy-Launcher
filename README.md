# About
This is my custom version of the Renpy Front Page. It puts the "Launch Project" button on the top right. I do this so I can put the window in the bottom left corner of my screen so that only the Launch Project button is visible. This saves useful screen real estate. I also disable skipping in the launcher, since this it has not function other than displaying an annoying graphic.
