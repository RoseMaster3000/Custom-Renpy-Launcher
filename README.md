# About
This is my custom version of the Renpy Front Page.

* The "Launch Project" button is moved to the top right of the GUI. This is done so that the window can be dragged to the bottom left corner in a way that only the "Launch Project" button is visible.

* Skipping is disabled. Skipping has no function in the launcher, and leaving it enables results in a usueless graphic when the CTRL key is pressed.
